1) Crypto improvements

 @ryancdotorg identifies the following weaknesses in multitun's crypto:

* Use authenticated encryption (OCB, GCM if you have libs that do those,
  CTR+HMAC otherwise) to prevent tampering.

* Use different, "unrelated" (e.g. use HKDF) keys for each direction of the
  connection.

* Use a different ephemeral master key for each session (perfect forward
  secrecy) - this is normally done with an authenticated diffie-hellman key
  exchange. The cool kids these days are using curve25519.

* Use constant time compares for validating MACs and password hashes.

* User key stretching on passwords - scrypt or PBKDF2 with a work factor that
  makes it take at least a few milliseconds.


2) Accept multiple simultaneous users with seperate credentials
