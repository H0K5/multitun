# Multitun Linux installation instructions
#

1) Install python-devel (aka python-dev), pip for python 2.7,
   and setuptools

2) As root: ./setup.py install


#
# Multitun BSD/MacOS installation instructions
#

1) Install TUN support
  For Mac you might use: http://tuntaposx.sourceforge.net/
  For BSD TUN may be enabled by default (verify with: ls /dev/tun0)

2) Install setuptools

3) Run ./setup.py install


#
# Multitun Windows installation instructions
#

1) Download and install tap-windows from https://openvpn.net

2) In my case, the TAP interface was in the control panel after tap-windows
   installation (Control Panel->Network and Internet->Network Connections).
   If not, you might have to run (Start->TAP-Windows->Utilities->Add a new
   TAP virtual ethernet adapter) first.

3) Rename the adapter by right clicking.  You may want to rename it 
  'multitun'.  Edit the adapter to use the multitun IP information, and
  turn off everything except IPv4.  You might want to leave the 'default route'
  in the TUN interface configuration blank.

4) Download the latest Python 2 version from https://www.python.org/downloads/
   Install, selecting the defaults

5) Download pywin32 from http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/ and install it.
   You should install the py2.7 version for your architecture.  I think the
   architecture of pywin32 has to match the architecture of the Python 2
   version you installed... for me only the 32-bit version of pywin32 would
   install.

6) Download and install the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7:
   http://aka.ms/vcpython27

7) Run the ez_setup.py script on http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools

8) In the multitun directory: setup.py install

9) In the configuration file, set tun_dev equal to the name of the TAP
   interface you set in step 3
